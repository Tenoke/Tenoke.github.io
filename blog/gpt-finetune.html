<h1 class='text-center'>Generating Fake Conversations by fine-tuning OpenAI's GPT-2 on data from Facebook Messenger</h1>

<h3 class='text-center'>Using Google Collab</h2>

<h5 class='text-center'>March 12, 2019</h5>
<br>
<br>
<p>One of the most interesting problems in NLP has always been human-like conversation and many are still considering passing the Turing Test as the holy grail of the field. In this post, I show how to use a state of the art model on your own data (I use my own messages sent on facebook) to generate (somewhat) realistic conversations.</p>

<p>In February 2019 OpenAI released <a href="https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/">information on their new state of the art language model</a> which created a lot of buzz within the community. While few disagree the results they included are better than anything we've seen before (even if mainly because they made a bigger model combining recent advances), many were peeved that OpenAI only released a small pre-trained version of their model rather than the full one they generated examples with. Nonetheless, the small model is also very good, and due to <a href="https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2">nsheppered's</a> addition to their code, we can easily fine-tune it on our own data to easily generate (near-)state of the art results specific to whatever we want.</p>

<p>Since then people have been experimenting with the model, including some like the aforementioned nsheppered adding simple scripts allowing us to fine-tune the model on our data. In this post, I am going to describe how to use easily available tools like those scripts, Google Collab and Facebook's Data Export in order to create borderline realistic conversation snippets (and a bunch of unrealistic ones). </p>

<p>If you don't have enough data on facebook, you should be able to easily export your conversation data from pretty much any other service and train on that. Better yet, you can combine data from different sources - as usual with machine learning, the more data you have the better.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">You can follow in the collab <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OiieFQZyROURR9kvfrsytsy4lGTSSIwP">here</a>. Make sure to click Runtime> Change Runtime type> GPU (or TPU)</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>We start with the imports</p>

<p><code>
import os
import json
import random
import re
</code></p>

<p>Then we clone <a href="https://github.com/Tenoke/gpt-2">my fork</a> of <a href="https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2">nsheppered's GPT</a> finetuning repo - I've only made some small changes to it - mainly adding a couple of extra command line options for changing things like the learning rate and adding a stopping point. We also cd into it, and install the requirements and download the model.
<pre><code>
!git clone https://github.com/Tenoke/gpt-2.git
cd gpt-2
!pip3 install -r requirements.txt
!sh download_model.sh 117M
</pre></code></p>

<p>Next, we need to download our facebook messages. Facebook explains how to do it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992?helpref=hc_global_nav">here</a>. Only select 'messages' and for the format select 'json'. After it is ready you can either download the file by clicking download or by using Dev Tools. To do so open them with F12, go to sources, and click download (and then just cancel it), then find the entry starting with file.php, right click it and 'copy as curl' as in this screenshot

<img class="img-fluid" src='/static/screenshot-fb.png'>

then just add ! in front of the command (to run it in collab) and <code>--output fb-json.zip</code> at the end to name the file.</p>

<p><code>
!curl &lt;link&gt; --output fb-json.zip
</code>
<br>
After that, we unzip the file and get a list containing all files with message data (as opposed to the other stuff that facebook includes in the zip)</p>

<pre><code>
<p>
!unzip fb-json.zip</p>

<p>files = []
for p, d, f in os.walk('messages/inbox'):
    for file in f:
        if file.endswith('message.json'):
            files.append(f'{p}/{file}')</p>

len(files)
</pre></code>

<p>You should see a non-zero number at this point if everything is going as planned. In my case 560.</p>

<p>I've also included a few functions - one to fix the encoding and escaping in facebook's data, and two to detect cyrilic so I can exclude any non-English chats I have. (this part would be irrelevant for most)</p>

<pre><code>
def fix_encoding(s):
  return re.sub('[\xc2-\xf4][\x80-\xbf]+',lambda m: m.group(0).encode('latin1').decode('utf8'),s)
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is time to actually create a corpus from all those files. If you have a lot of data, you might want to do this in steps. There's also a <code>banned_names</code> tuple where you can add any names you don't want to train on.</p>

<pre><code>

<p>text<em>corpus = ''
banned</em>names = ('vladislav')
for file in files:
  with open(file, 'r') as f:
      try:
        msgs = json.load(f)['messages']
        msgs.reverse()
      except:
        pass
      else:
        if not any(bn in file for bn in banned<em>names):
        for msg in msgs:
          try:
            content = fix</em>encoding(msg['content'])
            to<em>add  = f"({msg['timestamp</em>ms']}) {msg['sender<em>name']}: {content}\n"
            text</em>corpus += to_add
          except KeyError:
            pass
        print(file)</p>

text_corpus += '\n\n'
</code></pre>


<p>We then save the data to a file, check how big the file is (14m in my case) and encode the data (unnecessary but it is faster if you do it before training).</p>

<pre><code>
with open('fb-cleaned.txt', 'w') as f:
  f.write(text_corpus)

!PYTHONPATH=src ./encode.py --in-text fb-cleaned.txt --out-npz fb-cleaned.txt.npz
</code></pre>

<p>It is time to start trainning!
<pre><code>
!PYTHONPATH=src ./train.py --dataset fb-cleaned.txt.npz --sample_every=250 --learning_rate=0.0001 --stop_after=251
!PYTHONPATH=src ./train.py --dataset fb-cleaned.txt.npz --sample_every=250 --learning_rate=0.001 --stop_after=751
!PYTHONPATH=src ./train.py --dataset fb-cleaned.txt.npz --sample_every=250 --learning_rate=0.0001 --beta=0.95 --stop_after=1251
</pre></code></p>

<p>At this point, we can see samples, although feel free to change the learning rate, beta or train for more cycles. The code so far takes under an hour to run for me but it depends on the size of your dataset among other things.</p>

<p>We need to first copy the new trainned weights.
<code>
!cp -r /content/gpt-2/checkpoint/run1/* /content/gpt-2/models/117M/
</code></p>

<p>After which we can either let it generate chats on its own with (temperature 1 can work better, so try it both ways)
<code>
!python3 src/generate_unconditional_samples.py --top_k 40 --temperature 0.9
</code></p>

<p>Or we can force it to give us chats with a specific person (or on a topic)
by running
<code>
!python3 src/interactive_conditional_samples.py --top_k 40 --temperature 0.9
</code>
And then giving it something like <code>(137378602389) Ioannis Agathocleous: hi</code> in the interactive prompt to get a chat with that person.</p>

<p>Here are some samples. Some are better than others</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>(134972898517) Ioannis Agathocleous: lol sounds better to me
<br>(1349728992965) Svilen Todorov: lol if its fine you wont be able to be a middle aged man without pay
<br>(1349680771216) Ioannis Agathocleous: but thats kind of what you were meant to think
<br>(1349680826981) Ioannis Agathocleous: probs not

<br>(13496808683320) Ioannis Agathocleous: u know anyone else that can pay me in the end
<br>(13496808843212) Ioannis Agathocleous: i heard someone pay them last year and i want to buy a house
<br>(1349680884843) Svilen Todorov: yeh, well, its good to me as i can get some money with them
<br>(13496809066473) Svilen Todorov: i am
<br>(1349680951765) Svilen Todorov: and i wont have to bother with taxes and whatnot

<br>(1349680986601) Svilen Todorov: dunno if it wouldnt matter
<br>(1349680997829) Ioannis Agathocleous: if its going to be good Id expect them to do that

<p>The conversations usually make sense for the person. We discuss things like sleeping problems, how we are and what we are doing often so you get stuff like:</p>

(1519290549909) Svilen Todorov: but i dont really sleep much
    <br>
(1519290556640) Svilen Todorov: so it's a bit more fun

    <br>

    <br>
<p>(152665502433) Svilen Todorov: cool, nice!
    <br>
(152665505561) Svilen Todorov: did u check your messages
    <br>
(1526655031868) Eliza Beth: I've seen him before. This isn't the main one though. Maybe the one of you'll find out.
    <br>
(152665506496) Svilen Todorov: its more like what I saw at my friend's place and he was kind of curious so it might've been like some sort of a catch up, with some of the others' friends with a nice airheaded man
    <br>
(1526655080653) Eliza Beth: Jeez!
    <br>
(1526655087642) Eliza Beth: He says it's the only thing you've read yet lol
    <br>
(1526655089792) Svilen Todorov: well it's like a few people in my area, so i reckon thats where you're going
    <br>
(1526655053361) Eliza Beth: I assume he might buy it
    <br>
(1526655797371) Svilen Todorov: but you can still look for it now tho
    <br>
(15266557573782) Svilen Todorov: I dont know though
    <br>
(152665582321) Svilen Todorov: i reckon the first 2 days in a row wouldve gotten more in the first few days
    <br>
(1526658692365) Svilen Todorov: and you can buy it now if you only just know the local people
    <br>
(1526655791832) Svilen Todorov: tho he seems to think the local girl is the most famous person here because she's probably the best friend, so not sure whether she'll buy money for that
    <br>
(1526655871168) Eliza Beth: Omg dude how was work?
    <br>
(1526655781360) Eliza Beth: I think it's the same as the first few months. It was fairly fun
    <br>
(1526655892792) Svilen Todorov: but you'll be a bit more able to pick up for later
    <br>
(1526656997775) Svilen Todorov: i was telling people what you can do to get a flat or whatever</p>

<p>However, it sometimes makes understandable but amusing mistakes. E.g. my girlfriend has 'gay' in her name so it came up with this</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Some of the conversations look okay, though sometimes they are less coherent. It is clearly learning useful stuff - the timestamps generally go up, the conversations are relevant to the people in them, and so is the structure. Training it with more data would also definitely help.</p>

<p>Another way to make it produce slightly better results is to finetune it in the end on the chat from a specific person before generating conversations with them (I've added the relevant code to the collab).</p>

<p>We haven't gotten anywhere near passing the Turing Test but I suspect that if you hook this up to facebook's API to respond for you, it might take a while for some people to figure it out.</p>
