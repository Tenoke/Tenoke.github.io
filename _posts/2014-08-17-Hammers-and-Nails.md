title: Hammers and Nails
subtitle: Random excerpt from notes.txt

Overuse of tools is a very ubiquitous problem, and one observed in users of all sorts of tools - abstract or not. Some people really do try to use their hammers on things that are not nails, after seeing how it helped with fixing the shelf. Others, on the other hand, try to apply morals from parables to unsuitable situations.

I, for one, believe that in many, if not most cases, where someone is wrong, part of the fault lies in tool overuse. In fact, I recently told someone that probably the problem with some concept [of which I knew very little] in continental philosophy is the attempt to apply that otherwise useful concept to explan too many unrelated phenomena. 

Later on, I read up on the issue, and it seemed like I was wrong - there was no tool overuse going. This is when I realized that I've turned the hammer-nail concept into a hammer, and was seeing random [potential] errors as the nails. However, this does not seem to have disuaded me of using the concept - after all, the whole ordeal was actually a somewhat paradoxical proof (read evidence) of the validity of my theory.
