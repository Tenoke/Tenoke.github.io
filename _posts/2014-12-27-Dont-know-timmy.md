title: I don't know, Timmy, being rational is a big responsibility
---

Last week, I had the displeasure to travel home by night bus. It was a standard London night bus, typically full with rowdy drunk people going home at 5 am after a heavy Friday.

I was reading a short story on my tablet, trying to ignore the chatter, when the two girls in front of me started having a shouting contest with a guy sitting close to them. I didn't really get what it was about, and nobody else was stepping in, so I just watched. In the end the guy started getting close to the girls, who were getting more distressed and insulting him harder, so I said something along the lines of 'come on man, leave them'. A bit after that the girls started shouting about calling the police, spat on him, and got him to leave at the current bus stop. I caught the last few lines between them, and realized that the guy had felt up one of the girls, which is why this was happening.

I immediately felt bad, because I could've read the situation better and faster, and could've at least reduced their distress by getting the guy to leave earlier. And given that some of the other passengers nearby must've caught what was going on and did nothing about it, it was my duty to pay more attention and act faster (and in retrospect, I easily could've helped by doing that).

I got off the bus a few stops later, and thought of one of my favourite HPMOR quotes:

>"Of course it's my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible for anything."


It sounds poetic, but while applicable to HPJEV, I can't say that I am as unique as he is. I do think I know a bit more about certain things than most, but then again there are also others who do. There are others who know of and can stand up to the bystander effect. Others who try harder when evaluating evidence. Others who understand the value of carefully choosing a charity to donate to. Others who attempt to fight their biases. Others who..

But we are few and far between. So yeah, even if I am not the only one who is responsible, I am still one of those who are. In this case, I was responsible because I know of the bystander effect, and could have applied myself better in order to help. There are other cases, however - when I am the only one to point out a statistical trick or a mistake, when I can build something useful which isn't out there yet, when I can point to the truth, etc. To take this further - I am also responsible to get better, because I can, and because only a better version of me will be able to solve certain problems and help in some circumstances.
