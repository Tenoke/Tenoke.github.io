title: An ex-follower of the Everyman Sleep Schedule’s current views on Polyphasic Sleep
subtitle: A slight rehash of an old post of mine
---



Polyphasic sleep has been gaining attention in my circles, and as someone who used to be polyphasic himself, I often end up giving a short overview of my opinion on the matter. This is the written down version of said opinion.

I’ve been on the [Everyman-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep#Claimed_sleep_patterns) (ta schedule with a core sleep of 3 hours every night and 3 20 minute naps throughout the day) twice for extended periods. I’ve started dabbling with polyphasic in 2007, first for a few weeks at a time and then for ~3 months without a day’s break from the schedule. The second time was in the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009 when I stayed polyphasic for ~4 months.

Each time, during the first 3-4 weeks the experience was pretty awful but after that I felt as good as ever. Or so I had convinced myself – I have some reason to believe that this might have been a rationalization on my part due to the sunk costs of the endeavour. Long story short, both times I went back to monophasic due to external commitments – polyphasic is hardly comfortable when you need to stay out, nowhere near a bed, for more than a few hours at a time.

Based on those experiences, viewed in retrospect years later and significantly after the rose-colored goggles have came of, and based on many reports I’ve seen over the years I can say with some confidence that I do not think polyphasic sleep is a worthy venture for most people. My reasons for thinking so are as follows:

1. A large fraction of people (more than 1/3rd by any means and likely significantly more than that) seem to be unable to ‘power through’ and pass the hardest phase of a polyphasic experiment – the first few weeks. It was horrible for me and I already had plenty of experience with sleep deprivation and odd schedules; And any of my friends and many of the people I’ve talked to online completely fail to keep their schedule throughout this period (warning: selection bias). I cannot guess at how many of those lack the willpower and how many are physically unable to get enough rest to function while on polyphasic but either way – if you are one of those people then experimenting with segmented sleep schedules will likely be a net negative for you.

2. This is based to a larger extent on my own experience and involves more speculation but upon reflecting on my polyphasic sleep experiments (and looking through old posts and e-mails at the time), I believe that I was actually less mentally-capable during the time when I was supposedly comfortably polyphasic. What is worse is that at the time (after the first few horrible weeks), I had thought my functioning was on par with my functioning prior to the experiment(s) – it is harder to notice underperformance when you are constantly experiencing it. This of course might have only been happening in my case but if you manage to stay polyphasic and are like me – expect your cognitive abilities to weaken and for you to rationalize how they haven’t.

3. This is actually the main reason why I think that polyhasic is a waste of time for most people – it really does suck to live in a world where most everybody is on a different schedule, following different rules but you. This is the reason why even if you see someone who claims to have been successfully polyphasic for a long period in the past, they will have converted back to monophasic or perhaps biphasic if they are still feeling adventurous. Yes, you might think that getting extra free time is worth the sacrifice but will you think so every day for years? Or forever? Are you really going to sacrifice your ability to go out for a movie and dinner by converting to Uberman for example? Are you going to give up alcohol, stimulants (including coffee) and everything else that disrupts sleep because of your new and fragile schedule? You might think so – but who knows if you’ll think the same in <sup>1</sup> months or a year. Chances are you are going to give up and go back to more conventional sleep schedules and this is why polyphasic sleepers who have been keeping their schedule for years are so rare.2

I personally believed myself to be someone who would suffer the costs for the greater benefits but [me + 4 months] disagreed. Some people keep it up for longer, some do for shorter but can anyone claim that even a single percentages of wanna-be polyphasics keep up at it indefinitely? Or even for a year? I don’t believe so but I would be willing to update if someone shows me any evidence of that.
Those are the main reasons why I think that polyphasic sleep (perhaps not including biphasic) experiments are likely to be a net negative for those who attempt them. As a summary, I think that, that there is a decent chance (based on what I’ve seen) that a person will just merely disrupt their schedule for a few weeks, will be really unproductive during this time and in the end will give up before reaping any benefits. If this happens then the experiment has clearly been a net negative and if this doesn’t happen then they are still going to take a while before they benefit enough from polyphasic to make up for the lost time during the adjustment period. Furthermore, even after a person gets used to their new schedule there is still the chance that they will be unknowingly under-performing which makes up for a portion of the added free time. Last but not least, it seems very likely that the social problems that come from having a radically different schedule than everyone/most people around you will be enough of a drawback to cause a person to terminate the experiment. As I said these are the main reasons in my case, but there are likely other drawbacks – I haven’t even mentioned things like potential long-term consequences to health which many opponents of polyphasic will for example.

On the other hand, if you have very good reasons to believe that you are going to be physically able to keep up with a polyphasic sleep schedule (e.g. if you are ‘good’ at napping, able to fall asleep quickly etc.), potential mental under-performance is not a problem (e.g. free time is more valuable to you than the need to function at your best or you judge it as unlikely that such problems exist) and the rest of society and their ways do not influence you (e.g. You are a hermit) then sure, go ahead and try it. Otherwise, do you really think it’s worth it?

 

 

**Notes:**

1. One of the first modern cases of an alleged polyphasic sleeper is that of [Buckminster Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep#Scheduled_napping_to_achieve_more_time_awake), who appeared in Time magazine in 1943, and even he claimed that the experiment was ended due to objections from his wife.
